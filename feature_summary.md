✅ **Exhaustive mode explains ALL decisions with full transparency**
✅ **False positives analyzed FIRST, then correctly identified ones**
✅ **Clear reasoning for every classification decision**

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. UI Changes (main.py)**
- Added `st.selectbox()` dropdown with "Default" and "Exhaustive" options
- Updated `generate_and_download_report()` to accept `report_mode` parameter
- Modified download button labels to show report type
- Added distinct filenames for each report type

### **2. New Agent Tool (main.py)**
- Created `generate_exhaustive_report()` function with `@tool` decorator
- Processes false positives FIRST, then real outages
- Provides detailed weather threshold analysis for each decision
- Includes confidence levels and reasoning chains

### **3. New Prompt (prompts.json)**
- Added `"exhaustive_report_generation"` prompt
- Instructs agent to provide complete transparency
- Requires detailed explanation of EVERY decision
- Specifies exact format for threshold analysis and reasoning

### **4. Enhanced Data Processing**
- Sorts decisions: false positives first, then real outages
- Extracts detailed weather data for each decision
- Provides threshold comparison data
- Includes confidence scoring

## 📋 **How It Works**

### **User Flow:**
1. **Load Data**: Upload CSV file
2. **Run Validation**: Agent analyzes each report
3. **Select Report Type**: Choose "Default" or "Exhaustive" from dropdown
4. **Generate Report**: Click generate button
5. **Download**: Get detailed PDF/Markdown report

### **Exhaustive Report Structure:**
1. **Executive Summary**: Key findings
2. **FALSE POSITIVE ANALYSIS** (First): Detailed explanation of each misclassified report
3. **REAL OUTAGE ANALYSIS** (Second): Explanation of correctly identified outages  
4. **Threshold Transparency**: How weather thresholds were applied
5. **Decision Methodology**: Complete process explanation

### **For Each Decision, Agent Explains:**
- 🌤️ **Exact weather conditions** at time/location
- 📊 **Threshold comparisons** (what exceeded/didn't exceed limits)
- 🧠 **Reasoning chain** (why this led to the classification)
- 🎯 **Confidence level** in the decision
- ⚠️ **Any uncertainty** or edge cases

## 🎉 **Key Benefits Achieved**

### **✅ Transparency & Accountability**
- Every decision is fully explained
- Stakeholders can understand exactly why classifications were made
- Audit trail for regulatory compliance

### **✅ Quality Assurance**
- Verify agent decisions are sound and defensible  
- Identify potential improvements in decision logic
- Build confidence in automated classifications

### **✅ Operational Value**
- **False Positives First**: Immediately see what was incorrectly flagged
- **Detailed Reasoning**: Understand the "why" behind each decision
- **Actionable Insights**: Clear explanations support operational decisions

### **✅ Professional Documentation**
- **Standard Reports**: Executive summaries for management
- **Exhaustive Reports**: Technical detail for engineers and auditors
- **Proper Naming**: Files clearly indicate report type and timestamp
