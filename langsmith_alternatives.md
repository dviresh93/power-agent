## 🚀 Quick Start with LangFuse (Top Alternative)

```python

```

## 💡 My Recommendation

For your power outage analysis application, I'd recommend:

1. **Short term:** Keep LangSmith (cost tracking is now fixed!)
2. **If you need an alternative:** Try **LangFuse** (most similar to LangSmith)
3. **For cost savings:** Use **Phoenix** (completely free, open-source)
4. **For simplicity:** Enhance your current file-based logging with a simple dashboard

The cost tracking issues you had were specific to token extraction, not LangSmith itself. Now that it's fixed, LangSmith should work well for your needs.
