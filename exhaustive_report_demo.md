## 📋 **Sample Exhaustive Report Structure**

### **1. Executive Summary**
Standard summary with key findings

### **2. FALSE POSITIVE DETAILED ANALYSIS** ❌
**Report #1: 2022-01-01 00:00:00**
- **Weather Conditions:**
  - Temperature: 18.0°C (mild, within normal range)
  - Wind Speed: 8.0 km/h (well below 40 km/h threshold)
  - Precipitation: 0.0 mm/h (no rain, below 12.7 mm/h threshold)
  - Customers Affected: 1

- **Threshold Analysis:**
  - Wind Speed: 8.0 km/h < 40 km/h threshold ❌ (not severe)
  - Wind Gusts: 12.0 km/h < 56 km/h threshold ❌ (not severe)
  - Precipitation: 0.0 mm/h < 12.7 mm/h threshold ❌ (not severe)
  - Temperature: 18.0°C (normal range, not < -12°C or > 35°C) ❌ (not extreme)

- **Decision Reasoning:**
  - CLASSIFICATION: FALSE POSITIVE
  - CONFIDENCE: 95%
  - REASONING: Weather conditions were too mild to cause legitimate outages. Wind speed at 8 km/h is 80% below the severity threshold. No precipitation or temperature extremes recorded. Single customer impact suggests localized equipment issue, not weather-related infrastructure failure.

- **Why This Was Classified as False Positive:**
  - All weather parameters below severity thresholds
  - Single customer impact inconsistent with weather-caused outage patterns
  - Likely sensor malfunction or data processing error

**Report #2: 2022-01-01 01:15:00**
- **Weather Conditions:**
  - Temperature: 22.0°C (mild)
  - Wind Speed: 12.0 km/h (light wind)
  - Precipitation: 0.5 mm/h (light drizzle)
  - Customers Affected: 3

- **Threshold Analysis:**
  - Wind Speed: 12.0 km/h < 40 km/h threshold ❌ (70% below threshold)
  - Precipitation: 0.5 mm/h < 12.7 mm/h threshold ❌ (96% below threshold)
  - Temperature: 22.0°C (normal range) ❌ (not extreme)

- **Decision Reasoning:**
  - CLASSIFICATION: FALSE POSITIVE
  - CONFIDENCE: 88%
  - REASONING: Light wind and minimal precipitation insufficient to cause power infrastructure failures. Customer count of 3 suggests localized issue. Weather severity score: 15/100 (well below outage-causing threshold of 60/100).

### **3. REAL OUTAGE DETAILED ANALYSIS** ✅
**Report #1: 2022-01-01 01:45:00**
- **Weather Conditions:**
  - Temperature: 2.0°C (cold but not extreme)
  - Wind Speed: 52.0 km/h (high wind)
  - Wind Gusts: 68.0 km/h (very high gusts)
  - Precipitation: 3.2 mm/h (moderate rain)
  - Customers Affected: 45

- **Threshold Analysis:**
  - Wind Speed: 52.0 km/h > 40 km/h threshold ✅ (30% above threshold)
  - Wind Gusts: 68.0 km/h > 56 km/h threshold ✅ (21% above threshold)
  - Precipitation: 3.2 mm/h < 12.7 mm/h threshold ❌ (but combined with wind creates risk)

- **Decision Reasoning:**
  - CLASSIFICATION: REAL OUTAGE
  - CONFIDENCE: 92%
  - REASONING: High wind conditions exceed safety thresholds for power infrastructure. Wind gusts at 68 km/h can cause tree branches to contact power lines and damage equipment. Customer impact of 45 aligns with weather severity. Weather severity score: 78/100 (above outage-causing threshold).

- **Weather-to-Outage Causation Chain:**
  1. High wind speeds (52 km/h) stress power line infrastructure
  2. Wind gusts (68 km/h) can cause instantaneous equipment failures
  3. Combined with precipitation, increases risk of electrical faults
  4. Geographic clustering of 45 customers suggests widespread wind impact

### **4. THRESHOLD APPLICATION TRANSPARENCY**
**Wind Speed Threshold: 40 km/h**
- Applied correctly in 8/8 test cases
- Threshold source: Industry standard for power line safety

**Precipitation Threshold: 12.7 mm/h**
- Applied correctly in 8/8 test cases
- Threshold source: Historical outage correlation analysis

**Temperature Thresholds: < -12°C or > 35°C**
- Applied correctly in 8/8 test cases
- Threshold source: Equipment operational limits

### **5. DECISION METHODOLOGY**
1. **Weather Data Collection**: Real-time API data from exact coordinates
2. **Threshold Comparison**: Each parameter compared against established limits
3. **Severity Scoring**: Weighted algorithm considering all factors
4. **Customer Impact Correlation**: Verify alignment between weather severity and customer count
5. **Confidence Assessment**: Statistical confidence based on historical patterns
6. **Final Classification**: REAL OUTAGE if any threshold exceeded + customer impact correlation
