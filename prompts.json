Planned maintenance is misreported as unplanned outage\n4. Network communication issues create phantom reports\n5. Data processing errors or system glitches\n6. Testing activities reported as actual outages\n\nReal outages are typically caused by:\n- High winds: sustained >25 mph (40 km/h) or gusts >35 mph (56 km/h)\n- Heavy precipitation: >0.5 inches/hour (12.7 mm/hour)\n- Ice/snow accumulation: >2 inches (5 cm)\n- Temperature extremes: <10°F (-12°C) or >95°F (35°C)\n- Lightning strikes during storms\n- Equipment failures during severe weather\n- Fallen trees due to wind/ice\n\nAnalyze each report carefully considering:\n- Weather severity at exact time/location\n- Likelihood of equipment failure\n- Consistency with typical outage causes\n- Geographic clustering with other reports\n\nRespond with clear classification: 'REAL OUTAGE' or 'FALSE POSITIVE' and detailed reasoning.",
